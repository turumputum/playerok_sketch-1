## Options

The following environmental variables can be used to configure `file-manager`.

### SESSION_KEY=

Express session key, generate something random.

### SHELL=

Enable the shell feature, which allows users to start a login shell (when set to `login`) or the binary specified by this option (example: `/bin/bash`). Be careful when enabling this feature as anyone with access to this portal can execute any command on your machine.

### CMD=

Set to something other than "false" to enable running single commands in the default shell, usually `/bin/sh`. Be careful when enabling this feature as anyone with access to this portal can execute any command on your machine.

### PORT=

Listen on $PORT. Default: 8080

### KEY=

Setting this variable enables authentication using TOTP (RFC6238). $KEY is a base32 encoded shared secret. This key is only a weak means of protection as it is succeptable to brute-force. You can generate one from [here](http://www.xanxys.net/totp/) or manually.
